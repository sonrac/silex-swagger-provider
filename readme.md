# Silex coverage for functional tests

## Idea

Functional tests mechanism concatenation with emulation is called in unit tests. All function tests located in trait and include in functional and unit as trait

## Class description

| Class | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| BaseControllerTest | Base controllers test for unit testing |
| BaseWebTest | Base functional test controller |
| OnceMigrationUnitTest | Run functional test with running migration on test beginning and rollback after test finished |
| OnceMigrationUnitTest | Run functional test with running migration on test beginning and rollback after test finished |
| UnitTest | Base unit test with bases traits (BootTraits, MigrationTrait) |   

## Traits description

| Trait | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| BootTraits | Boot trait in class |
| InitMigrationTestTrait | Using for once run migration in unit or functional tests |
| MigrationsTrait | Trait for run migrations |
